                A model president of America- Barrack Obama , who spent his career to develop 
                his country and maintain a sustainable relationship with 
                lots of country
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2012, he was reelected over former Massachusetts 
                Governor Mitt Romney by 332 to 206 electoral votes. 
                The Middle East remained a key foreign policy challenge. 
                Obama had overseen the killing of Osama bin Laden, but a 
                new self-proclaimed Islamic State arose during a civil war 
                in Syria and began inciting terrorist attacks. Obama sought to 
                manage a hostile Iran with a treaty that hindered its development of 
                nuclear weapons. The Obama administration also adopted a climate change agreement signed by 195 
                nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming.
